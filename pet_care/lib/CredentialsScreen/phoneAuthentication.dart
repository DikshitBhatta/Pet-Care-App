/*
  Phone authentication is currently commented out because signup no longer collects a phone number.
  If you want to re-enable phone verification in the future, uncomment this file and ensure
  `userData['PhoneNo']` is provided during registration.

  The original implementation used Firebase Phone Auth to send and verify OTPs.
